## What is it?

Traccia Libri is a lightweight web app for small groups of readers who want to keep track of the books they read together. Each member can log their own books, share them with the group, leave likes and comments, and follow each other's reading activity — all in a clean, distraction-free interface.

No algorithms. No ads. Just your books and your people.

## Features

### 📖 Book Tracking
- Log every book you read with rich detail: title, author, publication year, page count, start/end dates, a favourite quote, a one-sentence summary, and personal notes
- Set each book as **private** (only you) or **shared** with a group
- Edit or delete your entries at any time, including changing visibility after the fact

### 👥 Reading Groups
- Create a group and invite friends with a shareable **invite code**
- Each group has a dedicated **Group Room** — a shared feed of all books the members have logged
- Group roles: **Admin** (creator) and **Member**
- Admins can remove members and delete the group; members can leave at any time

### ❤️ Social Interactions
- **Like** any book in your group with a heart toggle
- **Comment** on group books — leave reactions, thoughts, or questions
- Comments appear inline in the Group Room and on each book's detail page

### 👤 Profile & Activity
- Change your nickname, email address, or password from your profile page
- **Activity page** shows your stats at a glance (books logged, groups, likes given, comments written) and lists the last 5 interactions — sent and received — for both likes and comments

### 📱 Fully Responsive
- Works on desktop and mobile
- Mobile-first hamburger navigation with all links accessible with one tap

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no framework) |
| Backend / Database | [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (PostgreSQL + Row Level Security) |
| Auth | Supabase Auth (email + password) |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages |

### Database highlights
- **Row Level Security** on every table — users can only read and write what they're allowed to
- **`SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs** for group operations that need to bypass RLS safely (joining via invite code, fetching member lists, removing members)
- Cascading deletes keep data consistent when groups or books are removed

1. **Fork** this repository
2. Create a free project on [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
3. Run the full contents of `supabase_schema.sql` in the Supabase **SQL Editor**
4. Open `supabaseClient.js` and replace the two placeholder values:
   ```js
   const SUPABASE_URL  = 'https://your-project.supabase.co';
   const SUPABASE_ANON = 'your-anon-public-key';
   ```
5. In your Supabase project go to **Authentication → URL Configuration** and add your GitHub Pages URL to *Site URL* and *Redirect URLs*
